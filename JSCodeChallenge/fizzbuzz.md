## FizzBuzz Function Explanation

### Function:

```javascript
for (let j = 0; j < 50; j++) {
  console.log((j % 3 ? "" : "Fizz") + (j % 5 ? "" : "Buzz") || j);
}

Looping Through Numbers:

The loop iterates from 0 to 49.
Checking Conditions:

For each number j, the ternary operator (j % 3 ? "" : "Fizz") checks if j is divisible by 3. If it is, it prints "Fizz"; otherwise, it prints an empty string.
Similarly, (j % 5 ? "" : "Buzz") checks if j is divisible by 5. If it is, it prints "Buzz"; otherwise, it prints an empty string.
Output:

If neither "Fizz" nor "Buzz" is printed (i.e., both conditions are false), || j ensures that the number itself is printed.

Output: The function prints the FizzBuzz sequence.
